# URLink

URLink is a research tool that allows users to aggregate and reference different resources found on the web. Users can create a topic (something they are researching), and create subtopic pages within that topic.

Users can save any link, video (with embed code), and image url to a subtopic page.

Please check out https://vimeo.com/252540831 for a video demonstration.
